This will be the repository for all of our projects this semester. This course will be a lot of work, but should also be a lot of fun and we will come out of the course with a working knowledge of how to work in teams for software development.

## Updates for Sprint 4
- All pull requests must have a linked issue (set this up on the Project page)
- Please update the default branch to `sprint4`. This can be done in Settings > Branches > (left-right arrow icon) > sprint4 > "I understand...
"

Team Member Information: Unavailable

## Repository Setup
The repository will be set up in the following manner:
- All sprints will have a branch forked from the `main` branch. This should be referred to as the main sprint branch.
- The main sprint branches will be labeled as follows: `sprint1`, `sprint1`, `sprint2`, `sprint3`, `sprint4`, `sprint5`, `sprint6`
- Each team member should use their own branch of the main sprint branch. For example, `sprint0-micah` would be Micah's branch of Sprint 0.

## Forking and Merging Branches
- Please wait for the main sprint branch to be forked off of the `main` branch before forking it. This will make merge requests easier when we get close to the end of the sprint.
- Merge conflicts will be resolved by a simple majority vote when necessary.
